            After becoming an UX Expert profoundly interested in problems faced by efficient-to-spectacularly efficent keyboard users, I started writing about those issues in 2013–2014. With the belief that all of these problems could be eliminated from the modern front-end made available via HTTPs using various websites, I wanted to devise a solution which would eliminate the reliance on mouse devices to access the various elements of the web pages.
         </p>
         <p>
            I started work on this tiny application in the year 2013 or early 2014 to create a proof-of-concept utility which would prove beyond any doubt that all elements of the web pages can be made accessible quite easily just by putting some effort into design and implementation efforts. Owing to factors outside of my control, I somehow lost track of the development effort that I had started. Having regained some control over my faculties, I have decide to put finishing touches to that proof-of-concept project. 
         </p>
         <p>
            My aim is to provide spectacularly efficent access to all elements of the page by removing all of the hinderances from the design. It was and still is an attempt to wade the waters of minimalism in progromming, an attempt to use the fewest possible lines to achieve the maximum result.
