            <h4>People I absolutely adore, admire, or quite like.</h4>

            <p>
            A list of people whom I deem either truly remarkable or at least very good based on my personal interactions in life. Although most of my family members have proven themselves to be rather 
            <a href = "https://rigorous-mind.github.io/pages/pivotal-posts.html">horrendous folks</a>, nevertheless, I have had the good fortune of meeting some spectacular individuals during my years in the educational system and even at a couple of software houses here in Punjab. 
            </p>

            <p>
            Owing to certain undocumented issues, I am having some problems right now, however, I plan to complete the list later. However, to get the ball rolling, meet my favorice senior in town and two of my the most favorite class fellows, one a school fellow and the other one a batch fellow from FAST—NUCES, Lahore. Once I have the energy, I will add the names of the other individuals, from truly remarkably likable to quite likable, later on.
            </p>

               <em>Syed Zeshan Haider, from Kala Gujran near Jhelum</em>
               <p>
                  In my lifetime so far, I have had the opportunity to get to know a lot of people who managed to get 730–735 marks, approximately 86 percentage aggregate points, in matriculation exams and approximately 880–900 marks in FSc by showing unrivalled industriousness and maintaining infernos with the coursework. These people used to get up at around 5 AM, some even at 4:30 AM, and then spend the whole day with books to get those 730-735 and 880–900 marks in matriculation and FSc respectively. Then these people with 730-735 marks to their names start boasting in this world, despite the sheer number of hours they had spent with the books, that they are very competent people.
               </p>
               <p>
               In contrast, I had the absolute EUPHORIC experience of sharing a classroom from 8th grade till 10 grade with an individual with whom I locked horns in 4 different activities, yes, FOUR (4). Both of us were PROFOUNDLY interested in 2 of them, namely calligraphy and cricket; both of us represented our school as cricketers in 9th and 10th grade at regional level. Although he was also interested in education-related matters, however, I had very little interest in spending time with the coursework outside of school and absolutely zero interest in Urdu and Islamayat. He, on the other hand, was profoundly interested in those two subjects, too. Then comes the 4th activity, drawing, which was assigned to us by our teachers. He had a somewhat pronounced interest in drawing and he was quite good at it, while I, in contrast, had absolutely zero interest in drawing. Nevertheless, we had to do drawing projects because we had been assigned these tasks. Although he lost out in all four activities as teachers held my work aloft to show to the rest of the class in all 3 different categories and my name is written on the merit board as the school topper in 8th grade despite my lack of interest in educational matters outside of school, regardless, I still consider him THE MOST TALENTED individual that I have ever had the ABSOLUTE and wholly UNADULTERATED pleasure of sharing a classroom with.

                   Former dean of FAST, subsequently dean at Beaconhouse National University, and a complete course work in modesty and outstandingly good behavior. I adore Dr. Khaver Zia as a person who was an authority figure when I started to observe him and then had at least half a dozen conversations with him, oh the polite and humble manner of the dean of an engineering institution with a PhD from UMST in electrical and electronics engineering.

                     He was my class fellow at F. G. College Kharian, Cantonement, and his profile and listed achievements have left me truly impressed; that rarely happens. I don’t know about now, however, when we were enrolled at F. G. College, Kharian, he used to be a remarkably well-behaved young person. I wish him even better results in the coming years.

                  <p>
                     Outstandingly well behaved class fellow at FAST who taught me an invaluable and priceless lesson to try to persevere, may be more than a little, when life throws a curve ball, plans start to fail, or topics at hand or subject matter fails to hold your attention initially.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     It is to Qazafi’s credit that he also taught me the correct pronunciation of the word “fatal”. I hold the lessons taught by the guy extremely dear and remeber him extremely fondly. When it comes to all of the advice furnished and corrections offered, although I hold even the lessons extremely dear, however, when it comes to those conversions, the part that I remember in the fondest manner possible is Qazafi’s mannerism and etiquette. Where some pople start to make fun of another person that he or she failed to pick the correct pronunciation by the age of 19 years, Qazafi tackled the affoir in the most polite manner possible. A true gentleman sort of a fellow, Mr. Qazafi Qayyum. I will forever remember the lessons and his outstanding demeanor in the fondest manner possible.

                     Stellar class fellow and batch fellow at FAST, Lahore, who was always willing to lend a hand in the time of need when we were together at FAST. I remember this fellow extremely fondly.

                  <em>Ahmed Ayub</em>
                  <p>
                     A remarkably, rather sensationally, well-behaved roommate when I was staying in a small flat here in Lahore during my days at FAST. Sharing the room with him and spending that year and a half as his roommate would forever remain a cherished memory. I sincerely hope that he is enjoying life and doing well. Fables, movies, articles, short stories, and the rest always keep revolving around a certain trite concept, the sheer unlikelihood and improbability of finding a perfect flatmate or roommate. In my case, I was not only able to find a perfect roommate, even my flatmates, two brothers Fareed and Naeem, were extremely likeable fellows with just one minor flaw. I cannot say with any degree of certainty what sort of opinion they have of me as I was utterly uninterested in computing affairs at that time, however, I spent the best year and a half away from home in my life. Ahmed Ayub at the time was not only a good student but an excellent human, as well, who was probably deeply liked by most of his batch fellows at FAST. It is to Ahmed’s credit that he introduced my to one Raja Bhai from Sialkot who would eventually teach me some much needed basics of assembly programming. Raja bhai’s lesson eventually helped me learn to program a little in assembly and pass that course. The blame for that lesson does not rest with the teacher of assembly at the time at FAST; I had zero interest in computing at the time, hence, I was almost always in trouble. When it comes to my life in Lahore since the start of December, 1996, I probably remember that year and a half in the fondest possible manner.

                     Spectacularly well behaved woman. The truly remarkable and phenomenal experience of conversing with her on what is deemed by the larger society an exceptionally sensitive matter, body weight, would forever remain etched in my brain. This sensationally well-behaved woman with 923 marks in FSc tackled my question from a purely scientific point of view, and we had a short conversation on metabolism, body’s various mechanisms involved in converting food into energy, and how, on occasions, it fails to fully convert the consumed food into energy and starts to store it as access fat. It was an absolute joy conversing with this person as a young girl at FAST, Lahore, and even when she was working at Cressoft.

The fellow now works for Microsoft, and I am elated that he has been able to find success as a stellar software engineer. At least he used to be a spectacularly well-behaved individual; I can only hope that his colleagues share the same sentiment. Experiencing his mannerism would always remain a source of joy for me.

                     This guy has been my savior at least once. Without his help, I would not have been able to sit the final exam of Numerical Methods course as the teacher was just not willing to change the attendance sheet where I had not attended the requisite number of classes. He pitched in and somehow convinced the teacher to let me sit the exam. Forever grateful for that help.
