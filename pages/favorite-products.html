I will not be making a dollar or penny if you decide to purchase items listed on this page using these links. I have not taken any money from these companies, and these are just my favorite products that I have purchased from America or Europe in the last 10 years. The simple desire here is to help you, the reader, to benefit from an experienced person’s trial and error process so that you would not have to waste extra dollars while trying to refine your shopping cart or basket.

               I deem following items as thoroughly outstanding for people on a budget. They do not necessarily qualify as extremely cheap, however, for people willing to forgo some non-essential items for a couple of weeks to buy a properly enjoyable and durable product in any of the following categories, then these have been tried and tested by me, and I rate them as truly 5 star products considering their price. Considering the price, they only qualify as excellent products that do not break the bank. 
            </p>

               The “Buy On ...” links should take you to that particular product’s page on the mentioned company’s website. Links refer to product pages on the main companies’s pages and the base page of that company. You should not have to carry out a search after clicking the link.

                     Excellent devices for fiction readers. Do not purchase an eReader with a screen size approaching 10" or even larger if you do not plan to use it for designing and drawing work. eReaders with screen sizes approaching 10" become too big to handle for longer periods of time. Kobo Forma and Kobo Sage both have approximately 8" inches screen sizes, and I deem them perfect for longer periods of continuous reading. Also, when choosing an eReader, make sure that it has buttons to flip the pages on the sides rather than bottom of the device’s body.

                     For those of you who do not like to deal with the whole process of brewing coffee, I have not been able to find a better instant coffee. Nescafe’s Taster’s Choice French Roast is the best instant coffee that I have tasted to date. I started drinking coffee when I was 14 and now I am 46, and even after a prolonged period of 32 years of tasting various brands and flavors, Taster’s Choice French Roast still remains the best coffee that I have ever sipped.

                  <p>
                     To date, these scissors remain the only pair that have not caused any discomfort while trimming my nasal hair. I have this feeling that my nasal hair grow at a slightly faster rate than the average person’s nasal hair. Consequently, I have to use them quite often. This pair by Tweezerman has so far remained the best in class. Highly recommended for those who have problems with nasal hair.

                     As a once top-rated calligrapher in my school, I have tested the 1.5 mm and 6 mm nibs, and I have found that 1.5 mm is too narrow to create satisfactory works and 6 mm becomes too wide for small A4 sized papers; 6 mm would probably suit those working on big charts or trying to create larger works. Nevertheless, the quality of their nibs was excellent. If you would like to play with different widths, then give them a try to find what suits your tastes.
