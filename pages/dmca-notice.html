               All content protected by DMCA; I, Irfan Surdar, currently a resident of Lahore, Pakistan, reserve all rights in all of the content published on this blog. As an extremely competent and decent indivual with an almost squeaky clean and unblemished character record belonging to this horrible clan hailing mostly from Mulehal Mughlan with ties to even more outstandingly notorious families from Noorwal, I have witnessed all of these historical details.
            </p>

            <p>
               As no other person has so far written about these truly destructive, spectacularly corrupt individuals, hence, any attempts to create derivative works, whether written or digital (video or audio), would be deemed plagiarism and theft of an individualâ€™s copyrighted works. In unequivocal and explicit terms, I would like to state that no other person, whether related or unrelated to me, has the right to reproduce or create works based on these posts. Anybody, whether a scholar or person belonging to media business would first need to acquire my written consent and agree financial terms to either reproduce or create derivate works based on these completely orginial posts detailing the horrific conduct of four different clans and three different armed forecs generals.
