         During the first eighteen years of my life, owing to the nature of my father’s job, I got the chance to live or study in four different cities. However, the time spent with the people visible in the attached photograph and under their tutelage would for ever remain one the best and most cherished experiences of my life. Not a week goes by in my life that I do not think about them, and people shown in this photograph, Amir Sahab, Samad Sahab, Taufeeq Sahab, Ali Haider Sahab, the beloved Riaz Dar Sahab taught with the diligence needed to turn a capable student into a person capable of participating on the global scale.

         These people who have left an indelible mark on my cerebrum are known in my room as the “Bicycle Brigade.” The teachers, despite their such meager or scant salaries that they were not in a position to buy brand new 150 cc motorbikes, yet they were showing up every day and regaling students like me with their unflinching desire to do their jobs well. I absolutely salute these people and the services rendered by these people. Some of the fondest memories that I have so far amassed in my life revolve around the existences of people like Amir sahab, Riaz Dar sahab, Samad sahab, and Taufeeq sahab. The rest of the teachers were equally good, however, I did not get the chance to interact with them that much.
