               <h1>Is Telepathy Real? Do Telepaths Exist? Do We Really Dream Or Are They Merely Projections?
            </header>
            <section>
               <p>
                  When I was growing up in the city of Jhelum, I met a young teenage boy named Zeshan Haider in 8th grade. During our very first meeting near what used to be our F. G. School’s football ground’s goalpost, he started conducting an interview to get to know me better. During that interview, he asked various questions to get to know me and my habits better, and one line of questioning focused on whether the tale involving the telepaths in the series Daiwta in what used to be Suspense digest was real or not. Initially, Zeshan’s questioning focused on what sort of books and digests I used to read, and whether I had ever read stories in Suspense digest? Upon becoming aware of the fact that I used to read Suspense and Jasoosi digest regularly, he started inquiring about the tale discussed in the Daiwta story. When I started mentioning the characters and the fact that I used to follow that tale with some fervor, he inquired about my opinion or faith in telepathic powers. I told him that I considered it merely a work of fiction and such transference of thought or power was not possible. 
               </p>
               <p>
                  Upon hearing my comments and views on the matter, Zeshan firmly dismissed my statement and said that I was unequivocally incorrect on this matter. He went on to say that he had known with certainty that telepaths existed, telekinesis was possible, and people had the ability to STEAL — major emphasis on the word steal as people in Hollywood have been stealing information from my room and creating movies around them — some of our thoughts and ideas without even entering our room. The confidence with which he dismissed my statement that telepathy was merely a fictional tale and how he know of telepathy, telekinesis, and remote stealing of thoughts later convinced me of the fact that one such person must have lived in his village, or near his village, and convinced him of his powers by using his ability to read people’s minds. 
               </p>

               <p>
                  Akin to the encounter with Zeshan, while I was still growing up in Jhelum, we used to visit my father’s sister living in Mangla who was teaching Urdu in F. G. High School which was situated away from the cantonment and was an Urdu medium school. During one such trip to Mangla, I straight away reached for the kitchen of her house which was the nearest to the entrance of her house. When I entered the kitchen, I saw that she had an unusually large sized pot on her electrical stove and was busy making subcontinent’s traditional kheer for a large gathering. When I inquired that phopho/aunty why did you have such a large pot on the stove, she inquired in a quizzical manner that did I not know that telepaths existed and they were capable of transferring thoughts from one person to another? With that said, she then replied with utmost confidence that she know on that day that Anwar, name of her brother and my father, would visit her that day, and she was making kheer for the whole family.
               </p>

               <p>
                  Having heard about telepathy from just two people in the city of Jhelum, I forgot all about telepathy and entered university wanting to become a mechanical engineer. However, instead of finding myself at a university teaching mechanical engineering, I found myself at a computer science institute as I had been forced enrol for a computer science program under severe duress by my father. Owing to my profound interest in mechanical engineering, for the next 3 years, I failed to develop any interest in computer science. Had it not been for a repeat course of data structures in the summer of 1998 under the tutelage of Rehan Ahmad, I would have failed to learn any subject well. However, Rehand Ahmad sahab was able to teach me programming and data structures so well that within a short duration of two months, I became quite a proficient programmer. However, I once again lost my way as a student when he left as a teacher and usual proceedings returned, meaning that I once again failed to learn any other subject well. Nevertheless, despite multiple major shortcomings in my understanding of various computer science subjects, in the March of the year 2000, I started a job as a junior software engineer at Vroom Technologies (formerly WorldWerx Inc) where more than a dozen or so of former FAST, Lahore graduates were working.
               </p>

               <p>
                  While I was working as a trainee junior engineer at Vroom, in the April or May of 2000, a senior member of the Vroom Technologies staff named Ali Ahsan started chatting with me while I was still seated in the area reserved for the trainee junior engineers. During that chat, Ali Ahsan, just like Zeshan Haider in 1992, brought up the subject of telepathy. He inquired in that hall that had I ever heard of or met a telepath, and having forgotten about the short chat with Zeshan Haider in 1992, I said that I had never heard of or met any telepaths. Eventually, Ali Ahsan told me that telepaths most definitely existed, and one such woman had made a name for herself in Lahore, as she was selling her abilities to read the brains of all those willing to try her as a telepath. He then told me that another graduate of FAST named Kashan, probably from the 1993 or 1994 batch, had tried her telepathic abilities. Although I have never met Kashan in person, however, based on whatsoever I had heard about him during my time at FAST and during that short conversation with Ali Ahsan, Kashan had by then participated in a lot terrible to horrible activities, and that telepath woman revealed such horrible details of his activities over the years that he left her room bawling like a child. I have been told that the woman remained in business for quite sometime even after that.
               </p>

               <p>
                  For the next six years, starting from the year 2000 and ending in the year 2006, I kept stumbling from one idea to another thinking that I would be able to get a foothold in some position, however, nothing much interested me as I was still not ready to enter the world of computer science with the utmost focus and energy. However, by the end of the year 2006, I had lost interest in becoming a full time poet, journalist, and investigative author and reached the conclusion that it would be best for me to enter the world of computing with whatsoever little I had learnt during the two courses of data structures and compilers and start over. I started by making simple web applications. However, soon concluded that I would need to read the whole of the CSS specification to design the front-end part of the web applications quickly and without making too many mistakes.
               </p>

               <p>
                  After thoroughly reading the CSS specification, which is quite simple, by the way, I became a much more competent and proficient front-end developer within a short span of time. During the next three years, I created plenty of small web applications and tested at least a few methodologies of writing front-ends concluding with firm belief that I loved writing the least amount of code or markup that is needed to accomplish a given task. I absolutely adored and still adore following the mantra of separation of concerns religiously. I still refuse to clutter the markup with any unnecessary class or ID names.
               </p>

               <p>
                  Form an ethics point of view, I consider it malpractice on the part of the front-end development community where they keep on adding gratuitous HTML divs and class names whose inclusion results in an indefensible burden on poor users’ data plans. For your reference, I have included the details of a redevelopment effort involving a mainstream British website using the methodology I prefer and its results in my LinkedIn profile. To further corroborate my views, I am including a link to an article devoted to this matter. You can access the article by clicking the following link:
               </p>

               <p>
                  With so much testing done and multiple dozen CSS and JavaScript files written to redefine the layout of dozens of websites on the Internet, I embarked on a writing project to write a critique of the interfaces exposed by the top five most used web browsers in the world. Before starting the project, I had already conversed with the QA team of the most refined web browsers for the superusers, Opera 12.0. Having submitted and verified eight different bugs to Opera’s QA team, I then embarked on the writing project with some fervor, and I managed to release the first booklet discussing the UX flaws in all of the interfaces of the most used browsers which required almost 130 pages. However, since releasing the book, I started to notice that almost all of my efforts were going unnoticed, and I started to write about political matters, mostly on twitter using tweets. When I first published the book in 2011 or the revised version in 2012, the same former friend from eight grade, Syed Zeshan Haider, with whom I had lost contact at the start of 2003 showed up on Instagram using the Handle ZashTheBookMarketer or Zash_TheBookMarketer.
               </p>

               <p>
                  I can say with utmost confidence that I had not told anybody within my once close circle of friends that I had been working on a book, and I was pretty sure that nobody knew that I was working on a group. However, the very person who had once told me about the existence of telepaths showed up my Twitter feed with the Marketing Handle and wanted me to work with him based on mere guesses that I was probably dealing with him; knowing my talent full well and with the help of his connections, he was probably trying to take advantage of my existence as I had declared all of my paternal family members horrendous and done my absolute best to eliminate them from my life. However, with the help of their connections in the judiciary, armed forces, and political parties, they kept stalling my life and kept trying to take advantage of my outstanding existence. When it comes to Zeshan, the same guy’s handwriting samples started to show up on Clotilde Dusoulier’s website, and some third party started to use his face in adverts knowing perfectly well that I had known him since 8th grade, and we used to be once best friends in 8th and 9th grade. Owing to the ambiguity involved in the manner in which he was conducting his affairs on Twitter, I declined to connect with him on social media. However, I have recently been told by some people whom he has used to acquire some financial stability that he was, in all likelihood, stealing my content and using it for personal gains. Even the movie Thor, the first instalment, is based on activities that have taken place in my room and came out.
               </p>

               <p>
                  When it comes to writing content, writing has been a past time of choice since 9th grade, and I used to write extremely long letter to some of my closest friends in various cities. Since then and especially since the start of 2009, I have developed a profound interest in becoming an author. However, since releasing my book on web browsers and realising that strange activity involving the use of telepaths was taking place around me, I became more and more involved in writing about political matters, as well. Since the release of my first book, people using telepathy have been threatening me that they would not hesitate from stealing my content that I have published on the Internet and they are more than willing to use telepathic powers to steal the whole of my content that I have been saving on my hard drive to use as foundational work for some of my upcoming articles.

                  After Barack Hussain Obama started sharing his views on how to reduce the weight that children were carrying on their shoulders in the form of school bags, he started to share Apple’s iPads and similar devices that come with full connectivity as a solution. Having seen way too many casualties of governmental and parental failures around me while I was growing up, I immediately noticed the major flaw in the solution presented by Mr. Obama, and wrote a full length article to discuss the problems that such a device could introduce in the lives of both parents and young children. However, after I published the article in the year 2015, I started to loose my way as an author and computer scientist. Soon enough, I had completely forgotten about the five year plan that I had made for self in the year 2014–2015 and lost track of all of the 650+ Info Alerts in a folder which I had been managing to keep track of various types of data movements in the world which could be used to write a critique of modern democratic systems. After losing mental track of what I had been doing and getting my cerebrum shrouded in some sort of mental fog right after writing about Barack Obama’s plan, I simply lost track of what had been happening in my life.

               <p>
                  After losing track of all of my plans for the next 5 years at the start of 2016, I started to ask and answer questions on Quora. At some point in the year 2016 or 2017, my mother asked me to visit a doctor named Ali Mudhi who was working as a psychiatry consultant at Wilcare hospital. After my first couple of visits, I started to loose way too much energy from my body and soon enough started to become extremely lazy. All of it started after my first visit to Wilcare and meeting doctor Ali Mudhi as if he was running some sort of pharma cartel that was making his patients loose focus, energy, and desire to work. After spending some three years dealing with that dense brain fog, I eventually rediscovered a former friend on Facebook who has been working as a medical doctor in the UK. As soon as I rediscovered that guy on Facebook who goes by the name of doctor Babar Sheeraz, formerly Babar Sheeraz Rana from Jhelum, on the 30th of March, my energy levels started to improve. He then sent me to a female doctor named Samira Qambar Bukhari who was working at Bukhari Clinic.

               <p>
                  Staring from year 2015 and ending in 2019, during all this time when I was having tons of problems with brain fog or haze in which some third party had plunged my cerebrum, my new found inability to grasp knowledge, remember stuff, hearing tons of voices of people whose voices I was able to recognize and those whose voices I could not recognize, dwindling energy levels, and spectacular levels of brain fog, I kept trying to glean information from the psychologists that what exactly was happening to me. I had been a former school topper who topped the school while participating in 5 different extra curricular activities, and I had just about never had any problems with learning even difficult subjects. However, all of these psychologists and psychology journals kept brushing these question under one vague term, most often “hallucinations,” or another, “excess fatigue owing to burn out”. When I told them that I had never had such issues, nobody was willing to provide a clear answer.

                  However, in the year 2008, I had stumbled upon a British sports anchor named Amanda Davies who was working for BBC corporation. As I was single at the time and was not aware of her marital status, I sent her a letter with the desire to become friends with her. Having sent that letter, I then became involved with my writing and computing affairs and started working towards that book. During the year 2013, I had an outstandingly strange incident involving the sports anchor I have just mentioned. I had completely stopped following the sports show and all of her accounts in either late 2012 or early 2013.
               </p>

               <p>
                  Having stopped watching her show in the late 2012 or very early 2013, in the June of the year 2013, while I was asleep, my cerebrum got bombarded with a strange imagery — I like to call them projections, whereas the psychologists while lying to the people call them dreams generated by the subjects’ subconscious. The projections that were created on my asleep cerebrum involved the sports journalist Amanda Davies first standing in a velodrome in Milan, Italy, and then getting her buttocks and foot size measured while still in that velodrome. As I had stopped watching her show over 3 months prior to the bombardment of those projections on my cerebrum, I had absolutely no idea where she was planning to go or what sort of sports event she was planning to cover. However, as the projections involved her appearance in a velodrome, I visited her twitter account to see what sort of content she had been posting or what sort of events she had been talking about on her Twitter account. I immediately found the video whose content had been projected on my cerebrum the night before, and it left me absolutely stunned to know that they had shown projections of a show straight on my brain and she had actually appeared in that show. The very incident brought back the memories of those two chats with Zeshan Haider in 8th grade and in Mangla at my phophos house, and one chat that I had with Ali Ahsan about the manner in which a telepath was able to read the whole of his brain and reveal the gory details of his conduct over the years.
               </p>

               <p>
                  When it comes to my claim that I have had a profound interest in writing and weaving narratives, I still have over 30 letters from friends sitting with me in my cupboard, all written in English from various cities and Punjab region of Pakistan and some letters that I had received from friends from a couple of cities in the UK.
               </p>

               <p>
                  After some three years of uninspired writing and reading on Quora, I eventually started to hear a tad too many voices and started to loose too much focus. As I was plunging more and more in despair and becoming somewhat erratic, I started to become suicidal. During one such moment of profound unhappiness while thinking about what lied ahead for and zero desire whatsoever to converse with Amal Clooney, I started to hear a voice going absolutely berserk inside of my head, as if someone had gone completely mad after becoming aware of my plan to commit suicide, that Amal Clooney was somehow involved in the whole of the affair that relied on garbling of system and causing my brain to plunge in haze and darkness. As I was somewhat in the middle of deciding what to do with my life, for the next few days, that voice which I was not at all able to recognise kept mentioning incessantly Amal Clooney’s name and asking me to contact her on Facebook instead of taking any dire actions. Owing to the incessant mentioning of Amal’s name, instead of taking any dire actions, I decided to write a short post on her Facebook contact.
               </p>

               <p>
                  The repeated mentioning reached such levels that I eventually decided to send her a message on Facebook regarding the decimation of my rights in Pakistan. Although I never received a response from the human rights champion — apparently the violations against the rights of outstandingly competent men do not register as grave enough issues on her radar to be taken seriously — nevertheless, my ability and desire to write long-form has returned since then. This raises the outstandingly interesting question that how on earth can just a letter to a human rights’ activist restore a person’s ability and desire to write, which that person had possessed since his mid-teens, if that disappearance of the desire was not something imposed on him? The only logical and perfectly correct conclusions is that outside bodies can change a person’s desire and ability to participate in an activity without ever being present around him or her and without even introducing them to any addictive material that can change their neural pathways.
               </p>

               <p>
                  During the period starting from the year 2016 and ending in the december of 2020, a period lasting approximately 5 years, I had failed to write a single long-form article despite being the class topper in the compulsory English course at FAST where I managed to beat a girl by 20% points who eventually managed to obtain a masters degree from Cambridge university. Prior to that, I had been a school topper in my school F. G. School Jhelum, and remained a top 3 performer for starting from 6 till the end 9th grade. I failed to remain a top 3 performer in 10th grade as I eventually ended up participating in way too many actives. Despite my participation in 8 extra curricular activities, I still managed to hit an aggregate total of 665 out of 850 and 90 in mathematics and 88 in physics.
               </p>

               <p>
                  Although I had become somewhat active as an author since contacting Amal, however, in the late 2022 or early 2023, I started to document the horrific and gory details of the Mughlia clan from Mulehal and Chaudary clan form Noorwal. In the last 100 years or so, these two clans have managed to earn such horrific reputations as trespassers, gangsters, thieves, thugs, and harassers, that my elder brother started to create hurdles in my life as an author. I have received multiple death threats telepathically and the conduct of my elder brother and his wife have been becoming more and more threatening since my publishing of the horrific manners in which they have been trying their utmost to make me falter, using telekinesis to stall my typing speed. They have done their utmost to stall the publication of rigorously done materially which I could then use to create a short booklet and earn some money. My elder brother had been actively dealing with one of the most notorious members of the Mughlia clan named Omar Mirza, and he sold his 2015 or 2016 model Corolla to Omar Mirza, as well.
               </p>

               <p>
                  Having proven the existence beyond any doubt, especially using the examples of the Milan Clip that Amanda Davies shared on Twitter and which had been projected on my asleep brain the night before, phopho’s kheer story in Mangla, and the chat with Mr. Ali Ahsan when I was still a junior trainee software engineer at Vroom, I would like to make it well known that certain parties, as yet undocumented, have been using telepaths to threaten me with dire consequences. In the last 8 months, they have stalled the payment of the monthly stipend by at least a few days, and during those periods of extreme duress, they keep circulating in my head that the government, in which Aziz Mirza, whom I consider a horrendous, horrible individual, has way too many connected parties in the government, and he has been trying to stall the payment of your monthly stipend to spike your anxiety and make you suicidal so that you would publish your content for free and for people to use. Certain unnamed parties have been trying to get their hands on the incomplete drafts of my works for more than year, and to get their hands on my unpublished drafts, they have now started to resort to extreme tactics. They have been repeatedly stalling the delivery of my monthly tactic and some parties have been repeatedly shouting in my head that I will steal your content and you will not be able to do any thing about it. To keep a public record of the events that have unfolded in the last 12 months, especially the last 6 months, I want people to know that certain horrific parties are trying to steal my content and force me to go into a full panic mode. I have had to send multiple message in the last 12 months to various friends, who have yet to respond, to gain some semblance of calm and peace which would then allow me to finish and publish my first eBook. Although my circumstance has improved significantly since sending a Facebook message to a former friend who now works as a medical doctor — the message has dramatically reduced my anxiety and allowed me to finish this post — however, the road to the first thoroughly edited eBook general affairs and not on computing matters remains a dream.
               </p>

               <p>
                  The whole purpose of the post was to prove that telepaths exists, people can create projections on another person’s asleep brain, which the horribly corrupt fraternity of psychologists then calls dreams using one extremely vague and phoney term or another, and certain people can use these telepaths to steal other people’s hard work for their own good. Even within the confines of my room and without the presence of any other person, I have been told telepathically that you should hand over all of the rough drafts that are residing on your hard disk to us — the usual desirous parties of this activities have been presented as Aziz Mirza’s children and my brother Imran Mirza — and I have also been told that if I am not going to hand over the drafts, they would simply steal all of the information, and I would fail to find any legal recourse to defend myself. The whole of the system’s refusal to document the telepathic activity ginormously benefits people like Aziz Mirza and his outstandingly horrific, horrendous, repulsively corrupt children. They have been busy harboring some of the most corrupt and notorious members of the Mughlia clan in Omar Mirza, Hassan Mirza, and using them to trash other people’s properties immensely and steal other people’s stuff. In my case, as I am a knowledge economy worker and not an owner of BMWs or Bentleys, hence, they have started to use these telepaths to threaten me to steal all of the knowledge-based drafts that I have created over the last 10 years. Why the governments are declining to ban this telepathic activity? Their vociferous supporters and slogan chanters are benefitting from this activity tremendously.
