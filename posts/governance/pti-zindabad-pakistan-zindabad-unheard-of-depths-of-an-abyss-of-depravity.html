                  Spectacularly corrupt people regularly visited and loved by generals like Sahir Shamshad and ex-general Pervez Butt; appalling and ghastly levels of criminal activity taking place under the auspices of Aziz Mirza.

               <p>
                  The sheer good fortune of being born in Pakistan and witnessing the society at large is the sensational level of human rights abuses and corruption that a person has to witness. However, the magnum opus, the crowning glory, of all of the phenomenal levels of corruption perpetrated by Pakistanis and almost entirely funded by the UK and Europe is an individual named Omar Mirza, son of a phenomenal Abid Mirza who was himself an exceedingly notorious and remarkably incompetent mighty Mughal, who once again belongs to the mighty Mughlia clan from Mulhal Mughlan near Chakwal.
               </p>
               <p>
                  This phenomenal existence named Omar Mirza, loved by many in the sensational Mughlia clan, failed to manage a thoroughly inadequate but mandatory 33 percentage passing points, which are deemed by academics as an almost non-existent challenge and the lowest hanging fruit, in FA exams in the first attempt owing to his phenomenal levels of incompetence and a diabolical character. Because of his horrendous, diabolical character, he managed to earn almost unrivaled levels of notoriety in the whole of the Chakwal. Upon finally managing that scant, almost free for the taking, 33% in some third-class FA subjects, this spectacularly despicable person failed to pass his BA exams in some remarkably easy subjects thrice — not once, not twice, but thrice — owing to the mere fact that he never had the time available for studies as he was almost always busy with one nefarious activity or another and earning extreme notoriety for himself and his family. If investigated by some thoroughly honest investigator, which exceedingly rarely exist in Pakistan, he will almost certainly turn out to be one of THE MOST NOTORIOUS individuals from Chakwal.
               </p>

               <p>
                  Now this Koh-i-Noor, the biggest and most finely cut diamond in the grand collection of this marvelous clan comprising of some stunningly notorious people, has been working as an officer with some stated expertise that he simply cannot acquire in a charity called Plan International once again funded by the mighty and righteous UK. Throughout his early life as a school-going child and then as a young adult, he was only able to leave a long and almost never-ending trail of proof of one fact and merely one fact alone: he possesses diabolical learning abilities and can only work in menial jobs suitable for almost UNSKILLED WORKERS, jobs like a security guard at an office, a tea boy, a store assistant certainly not required to carry out accountancy work, a dishwasher at a large hotel chain, or a parcel delivery driver. However, the esteemed organization named Plan International headquartered somewhere in the UK has somehow managed to hire him as a specialist of some kind despite his remarkably diabolical educational track record which proves only one simple fact: he cannot perform tasks that require at least a somewhat acceptable level of competence.
               </p>

               <p>
                  This spectacularly incompetent person, who would ALMOST meet the incompetence criteria set for dysfunctional individuals in Europe and America, now drives a 2016 or 2018 Toyota Corolla costing approximately 20,000 US dollars or 55 lakh Pakistani rupees and earns in either US dollars or British Pounds all thanks to the sensational, almost unparalleled levels of “DECENCY” that British and European NGOs have been exhibiting in Pakistan. The wife of the aforementioned euphoric personality named Mehwish and her sisters are also almost certainly spectacularly incompetent women with, once again, almost certainly diabolical characters, yet all of them are working for one European or UK-funded body or another. European, UK, and American-funded organizations in Pakistan are busy employing such people, people whom just about nobody in Pakistan is willing to consider worthy of employment and who have exceedingly poor learning skills, and these organizations funded entirely by the West or America are busy rewarding them handsomely. Some of these inordinately diabolical characters then become the most vociferous proponents of spectacularly corrupt regimes in the UK, America, and some so-called rich European countries, and of course, the political parties, as well. These political leaders are busy ignoring all of the heinous crimes committed by these people because they extremely willingly keep chanting their slogans to get all the protections and large sums of money.
               </p>

               <p>
                  That’s how the propaganda in favor of the mighty UK and USA gets funded in Pakistan, by handsomely rewarding extremely incompetent to phenomenally incompetent individuals with diabolical track records who then perpetuate the usual tales of righteousness associated with these corrupt countries on various social media platforms. The news media outlets of these so-called rich countries are then able to use their anonymized statements to perpetuate this image that they have the data to corroborate the claims that people in countries like Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, and other places thoroughly approve of the workings of the UK, some rich Western countries, and American governments.

                  The place where he has been living for the past 3 decades is largely owned by an ex armed forces officer Lt. Col named Aziz Mirze, and former and sitting generals of the armed forces, namely Pervez Butt and Sahir Shamshad Mirza willingly visit the place despite knowing the horrendous characters perfectly well. The details of the outstandingly diabolical behavior involving multiple criminal deeds had been so widespread that Omar Mirza’s parents, despite a raging desire to find just a hardly acceptable daughter-in-law, kept getting rejected for over 15 years, yet these armed forces generals, namely Pervez Butt and Sahir Shamshad Mirza, keep visiting these people without any moral or professional dilemmas which should have been caused by the oaths they take demanding them to uphold the law and protect the people.
