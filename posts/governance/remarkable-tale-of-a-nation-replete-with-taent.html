            Our latest revolutionary, another in the long list of revolutionaries that Pakistan has managed to produce in the last 6 decades, has been shouting at the top of his lungs for at least 3.5 decades now that Pakistan is replete with talent. We have all sorts of talent that is waiting to be uncovered. Considering that I have grown up in this country and watched the esteemed nation dabble in all sorts of activities and produce diabolical results almost everywhere, so just last night I decided to take a look at Pakistan’s record in the summer Olympics in the last 75 years.
         </p>
         <p>
            Lo and and behold, the chest thumpers and slogan shouters of the latest revolutionary who goes around making one preposterous claim after another one, Pakistan has managed to win just two individual medals in its entire history as a nation. In the last 75 years, despite being a nation replete with talent according to the mighty Imran Khan who was educated at Oxford, Pakistan has failed to win a single — yes, a SINGLE — gold medal in any competition. Both of the individual medals are bronze medals, one in boxing and one in wrestling. That is the sheer amount of sporting talent that Pakistan has managed to produce outside of cricket and hockey in the last 75 years. Esteemed members of the phenomenally well-educated Pakistani nation please take notice of the sensational medal record that Pakistan has managed to amass since starting to participate in the summer Olympics in the year 1948.
         </p>
         <p>
            To make matters worse for the latest revolutionary, as if they were not already bad enough, members of the venerable armed forces of any country can represent their nation in any sport of their choosing. Considering that excelling in the use of the guns is the core business of members of the elite armed forces, why haven’t they been able to win even a bronze medal in 15 different events that involve the use of guns? UAE has a paltry, paltry population of a mere 9.7 million people and an extremely small royal family, yet even a member of the UAE’s royal family has been able to win an olympic medal in an event involving the use of rifles. Pakistanis, especially the Pathans like Imran Khan, go around boasting about Pathan’s and Baloch people’s love affair with the guns, yet when comes to producing an individual actually capable of beating the global talent, their efforts have so far produced 0 medals: some display of talent in the use of arms.
         </p>
         <p>
            Although I do not have much information on how different sections of the armed forces work, however, based on whatsoever I have heard so far, members of the armed forces in all of the cantonments have access to boxing gyms, and they are encouraged to take up one sport or another. If they have ready access to such facilities, then why has our elite armed forces so far failed to produce a single gold medal contender, or even a bronze medal contender, in so very many different weight divisions of the sport of boxing? Pakistan has so very many lakes and the officers of the navy tend to live their entire lives around water, so what has been stopping Pakistan’s navy from producing an even bronze medal contender in the various swimming competitions? I have spent time in two different cantonments, namely Jhelum Cantt. and Mangla Cantt., and both the cantonments had swimming pools for the officers and children of the officers of the armed forces. Why have they not been able to entice even one person to take this activity seriously enough to become a contender at the olympics level?
         </p>
         <p>
            With the mighty Khan’s incessant ramblings about profusion of talent in Pakistan never coming to a halt, I would like to ask the simple question that where the hell is all of this talent? Where are our world beaters and what the heck have they been doing so far? If we really are as spectacularly talented as the mighty Imran Khan would like us and the rest of the world to believe, then where the hell are the medals and the champions?
