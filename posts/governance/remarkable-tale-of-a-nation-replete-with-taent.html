               Our latest revolutionary, another in the long list of revolutionaries that Pakistan has managed to produce in the last 6 decades, has been shouting at the top of his lungs for at least 3.5 decades now that Pakistan is replete with talent. We have all sorts of talent that is waiting to be unearthed. As I have grown up in this country and watched the esteemed nation dabble in all sorts of activities and with diabolical results almost everywhere, so just last night I decided to take a look at Pakistan’s record in the summer Olympics in the last 75 years.
