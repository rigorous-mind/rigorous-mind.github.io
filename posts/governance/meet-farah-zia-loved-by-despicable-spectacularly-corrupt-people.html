            <p>
               Before narrating the tale of this woman’s reprehensible, criminal conduct so far and the general state of affairs in Pakistan, let me disclose the charges that I, as a person not well-versed in legal matters, feel should be leveled against her. I am certain that in a free and fair trial, which is spectacularly difficult to arrange in Pakistan, she would be found guilty of at least a few of the following charges. As an extremely concerned member of Pakistani society who has witnessed all of this conduct, I firmly believe that she should be tried and put behind bars without any leniency or plea deals. 
            </p>
      
            <p>
               As finding neatly presented digital documents in Pakistan, especially pertaining to the field of law, is a challenge, hence I will be using American documents to prove her reprehensible character and heinous and criminal misconduct so far. Also, I am presuming that various legislations on the wilful concealment of incriminating information for personal gains while acting as a person with a duty to care are almost identical in most jurisdictions. Therefore, my reliance on these documents describing laws enacted in the USA and the mighty UK should not prove a major misstep or critical mistake. Based on whatsoever I have read in the last 20 years on the mighty Internet, when people assume roles that involve a duty of care towards other people, especially the general population, it becomes their responsibility in certain roles to disclose certain details, no matter how damaging they may be for their so-called loved ones. Having stated my reasons for relying on international documents, let me disclose the charges that I firmly believe can be proven against this woman.
            </p>
      
            <p>
               Following is the summary of just a few of the charges that can be proven against this woman with a horrendous character with extremely poor academic record. 
            </p>

               <li>
                  Accessory After the Fact — The charges should include the charge of being an accessory after the criminal act had taken place while holding a duty of care towards the masses and getting rewarded for that position handsomely. 
               </li>
            </ol>
      
            <p>
               Before discussing this sensational woman’s conduct, let us switch our attention to the usual problems that ordinary people have to face, and how this woman has actively participated in making these matters worse. 
            </p>
      
            <p>
               General, oppressed population and unbiased writers with integrity alike have been saying for centuries that the official version of the “History” which is fed to the population is largely dictated by the sensationally corrupt and tyrannical ruling class. Despite the chanting of the slogans of “the venerated democracy,” rule by the people and for the people, little has changed in this world. An extremely small group of people, a handful of families of feudals and industrialists who ensure their existence by colluding with the feudals, have retained an almost iron grip on the affairs of the masses. Outside of these families of feudals and their cohorts, most of the educated individuals are born in extremely poor circumstances, and owing to their diabolical financial circumstances, they find themselves in a situation where to ensure their continued existence, they have to acquiesce to the demands of the despotic rule and maintain absolute silence on all of the corruption taking place around them. 
            </p>
      
            <p>
               I, on the other hand, have absolutely no desire to maintain any silence. While growing up, I was promised a decent, just, and meritorious society that would respect my reasonable decisions and grant me my freedoms. I was also promised a reward commensurate with my abilities and unyielding desire to carry out my duties well. The system has abysmally failed to deliver on any of these promises. Not only that, I have had the absolute and utter displeasure and an abhorrent experience of being a part of a family some of whose members are sensationally, phenomenally corrupt. When it comes to certain members of the Mughlia family from Mulhal Mughlan near Chakwal, these members of the Mughlia clan have proven themselves to be not only phenomenally incompetent, almost on the retardation scale with approximate IQs of around 85-105, but also hardened criminals who are also prodigiously talented ass-kissers, in other words, shit lickers, of the feudals from Multan and Sindh. 
            </p>
      
            <p>
               One of these sensational existences, a spectacularly dumb person who likes to present herself and her extremely dumb siblings as the mighty and spectacularly well-read intellectuals of society who are profoundly interested in cultural and judicial matters, goes around by the name of Farah Zia. She has been an “esteemed” investigative journalist for over 15 years now and her articles castigating the ways of the uncultured, unrefined, boors, and savages of the societies have appeared in multiple different publications originating from different countries. Almost to the point of certainty, she acquired her job as a journalist in Pakistan and all of the contracts with various international publications thanks entirely to her mother’s phenomenal connections with the feudals of Multan, the Gardezis, Gilanis, Legharis, and finally, Bhuttos of Sindh. 
            </p>
      
            <p>
               This woman, namely Farah Zia, is so spectacularly incompetent that having failed to perform to even an above-average standard during the first 12 years in the educational system when science and mathematics used to be compulsory, she failed to perform well even when the burden of sciences and mathematics was eventually lifted off of her spectacularly delicate shoulders and fantastically malfunctioning cerebrum. She failed to perform well in her undergraduate studies while studying some extremely easy arts subjects. After failing to get good grades in her undergraduate course, she then enrolled for a masters course, and lo and behold, once again, even the burden of spectacularly easy subjects proved too much for the magnificent Mughal from Mulhal, namely Farah Zia, who is a proud daughter of a feudal from Multan who goes by the name of Fazal Zia.
            </p>
      
            <p>
               What makes her breathtakingly long list of spectacularly below-par performances even more outrageous and horrendous is the mere fact that she was growing up in an environment that can only be termed luxurious by Pakistan’s standards. Her father — namely Zia Mehmood Mirza, another sensationally, stunningly incompetent individual who failed to pass his MA English exams in the first attempt — was an esteemed member of the judiciary and a member of the supreme court’s bench of judges; he got that job with the help of his wife’s connections with the feudals. They were living in a 4 kanal house in GOR 1 or GOR 2 near Race Course Park. Just a house on 4 Kanals of land in a large city is considered spectacular levels of luxury in Pakistan, however, as a member of the magnificently corrupt judiciary, astonishingly incompetent Mr. Zia Mehmood had more luxuries available to him. He and his magnificently incompetent children used to move around in a government paid and maintained Honda Accord. Rest assured that ordinary upper-middle-class people used to have trouble affording brand-new Honda Accords back in the 1990s in Pakistan, yet this horrendous, spectacularly incompetent individual named Zia Mehmood had all of the luxuries afforded to him by an outstandingly corrupt democratic system in Pakistan. Despite all of the luxuries and opulence afforded by the government and her father’s truly pronounced interest in her upbringing and his profound desire for her to join the civil service in Pakistan, this astonishingly incompetent woman eventually failed to pass the CSS exam mandatory to get a government job in Pakistan. 
            </p>
      
            <p>
               What makes her eventual failure to land a government job even more diabolical and abominable is the mere fact that my mother grew up in a family where her parents were not just uninterested in her education, they were openly hostile towards sending her to school and college. She has 6 other siblings of which 3 are or were her older sisters. All three of my mother’s older sisters are illiterate because their and my mother’s parents declined to send them to school after they had passed 6th grade. At least one of my mother’s brothers is also illiterate as their parents had very little interest in the education of their boys, as well. 
            </p>
      
            <p>
               To pursue education beyond 6th grade, my mother had to take a stand against her parents’ hostility towards her education. Based on what I have been told and what I have witnessed in her family, their hostility towards her desire to pursue higher education grew as she moved higher in the educational system. Although she was only able to manage a master's degree in Urdu, her mother tongue, an attainment that does not qualify as even satisfactory, however, after completing her master's, she managed to prepare for the government exam herself and successfully made the merit list to land a government job entirely on her own. 
            </p>
      
            <p>
               Where the daughter of an illiterate family managed to acquire the requisite knowledge to pass the government’s selection exam on her own, this strikingly incompetent woman named Farah Zia was unable to pass the exam despite her parents’ profound interest in her education, her upbringing in the biggest city of the Punjab province, living in opulence, and access to some of the best institution in the city of Lahore. Despite the combination of all of these factors that usually work in favor of the talented people capable of performing well, this woman who has been enjoying hefty paychecks from multiple publications failed to even pass the competitive exam. That’s the level of Farah Zia’s ability to acquire knowledge that a girl who grew up in a remote village near a very small city of Jhelum in a household openly hostile towards girls’ education was able to pass the competitive exam, yet this girl who grew up in a household in the biggest city of Punjab under the guidance of parents who wanted her to join the civil service and groomed her for the final appearance in the exam still failed to pass the exam. 
            </p>
      
            <p>
               The last nail in the coffin of her diabolical misrepresentation of herself as an intellectual and capable person is the mere fact that a lot of people in Pakistan with legitimately good grades either leave Pakistan for much better-paying jobs abroad or join organizations like universities as professors, banks as banking officials, or industrial units producing goods for local and foreign markets. The level of competition most certainly is not as tough in the civil service exam as it can be, yet this woman failed to pass that exam with a much-depleted pool of talented people. Approximately 70% of my matriculation and intermediate-level class fellows who were good in academics — names, grades, occupations, and chosen destinations available if and when needed — are now settled in one of America, Australia, the UK, or Canada. Some are even settled in Norway, Germany, and France. That’s the rate at which competent people are departing from Pakistan, yet she could not qualify for a government job on her own despite the depleted talent pool.
            </p>
      
            <p>
               Taking into account her level of incompetence and her mother’s sensational ties with the feudals of Multan, I am confident that she eventually found a job as a senior journalist and a member of the human rights body owing entirely to her mother and father’s combined connections. 
            </p>
      
            <p>
               As an “esteemed” member of the journalistic community, this phenomenally competent, sensationally decent, spectacularly morally upright, magnificently ideologically correct, and tremendously humane individual has been busy providing unmitigated protection to some of the most corrupt members of the Mughlia clan that I have ever met in my lifetime. Despite being a spectacularly different individual from them, immensely and exceedingly unfortunately for me, I am a part of the Mughlia family, hence I know their tales of corruption quite intimately. My father is Farah Zia’s first cousin and Zia Mehmood Mirza’s nephew, hence I was getting all of the information from a person who had extremely close connections with the family. My father’s last promotion to the rank of SVP (senior vice president), which he certainly did not deserve owing to his poor performances in FSc and BSc at F.C College, Lahore, was secured using the connections of Fazal Zia and Zia Mehmood Mirza. Fazal Zia, who hails from Multan and is a daughter of a landowner from Multan, has spectacularly close connections with the feudals of Multan and Sindh. Using these connections, that promotion was secured. 
            </p>
      
            <p>
               Although my mother had qualified for the government job on her own by passing the government-mandated exam, however, despite being an extremely good person otherwise, she was having trouble securing a promotion to the 18th grade owing to her lack of desire to stay beyond 2 P.M at her Population Planning office in Jhelum; her government department required its employees to stay at least until 4 P.M. When she expressed her desire to get the promotion to her husband and my father — this conversation took place right in front of me while I was still studying in Jhelum — with just a phone call to phenomenally judicious and esteemed Mr. Zia Mehmood, my father was able to secure her promotion to the 18th grade. That is just another example of corruption that esteemed and sensationally competent Mr. Zia Mehmood was busy perpetrating using his wife’s phenomenally close connections with the feudals of Multan and Sindh.
            </p>
      
            <p>
               Farah Zia’s elder brother, a spectacularly incompetent and phenomenally morally bankrupt individual named Shams Zia, has now managed to become an esteemed member of the judiciary in Pakistan. Considering all of the disgusting details that I had heard about him while growing up, I am certain that his appointment as a judge has been secured entirely using the phenomenal ties that his parents enjoy with the feudals. 
            </p>
      
            <p>
               While growing up and in his late teens and early 20s, this person named Shams Zia was known throughout the Mughlia clan living anywhere in Pakistan, a lot of whose members now live in the small city of Jhelum (names available if and when needed), as one of the most despicable characters ever to be born to a Mughal. He had such an outstandingly and remarkably bad character that at some point during his early-to-mid 20s, he managed to commit a crime of such spectacular gravity that the police officer who arrested him, despite becoming aware of the fact that he was the son of a sitting judge who had spectacularly close ties with feudals, declined to expunge the FIR written against the person who now gets called esteemed justice Mr. Shams Zia. Back in the late 1990s, he used to move around in a sports car that his outstandingly corrupt father had acquired for him from the Pakistan custom’s impound using his sensational connections. Despite knowing such magnificently influential people and carrying at least a significant amount of money as he was roaming the streets of Punjab in a sports car, he still could not convince the police officer to not write that FIR against him. 
            </p>
      
            <p>
               The news of Shams Zia’s arrest and the police officer’s eventual refusal to expunge the record spread like wildfire amongst all of the Mughals living in Jhelum and elsewhere. His incredibly connected father had to eventually use his wife’s connections with the feudals to get that FIR removed and clear his son’s name from the list of registered offenders and prevent that extremely serious case from reaching the courts. 
            </p>
      
            <p>
               Despite possessing intimate knowledge of all of these sensationally heinous acts committed by his outrageously incompetent and staggeringly corrupt father, Farah Zia has been busy castigating the rest of society and getting paid hefty sums for sharing her phenomenally biased, bereft of moral compulsion, and utterly devoid of merit thoughts on the acts and deeds of the other sections of society. By not disclosing the misdeeds of her father, mother, and brother, she can only be deemed an accessory to the crimes committed by her father and brother, as she has had intimate knowledge of all of the activities that were taking place. As a person working in the field of investigative journalism and castigating the rest of society, she has provided them with absolute protection from any criticism or disclosure of their despicable conduct over the years. That should, at the very least, result in a charge of phenomenal levels of criminal negligence and wilful concealment of criminal acts. While she was busy getting paid hefty sums for criticizing the rest of society, she obdurately declined to write a single piece disclosing any facts about the horrendous actions of her father and elder brother. 
            </p>
      
            <p>
               Investigative journalism and the branches of journalism that concern themselves with criticizing the rest of society, moral and ethical issues, meritorious award, eradication of nepotism, etc. demands full disclosure from the person writing on these matters. The core issue at heart is the mere fact that she should not have qualified for the job owing to her extremely poor academic performances. However, even if we were to accept that she possesses sound enough knowledge of linguistic and political matters, then over the last 15 years, she has provided unmitigated protection to her family from any criticism. She has been obdurately declining to reveal a single detail that could harm the financial health and social standing of her odious, revolting, and repugnant family. This brings us to the second charge of providing unqualified protection to criminals for personal gain. She has intimate knowledge of dozens of instances of abuses of power committed by her sensationally incompetent father and the Bhutto clan from Sindh. These revelations by a person of her stature who now has strong connections in the journalistic community could put to rest the political careers of Asif Ali Zardari and his prodigiously talented son — of course, sensational, stellar brainiacs choose to study history and philosophy — Bilawal Zardari for good. However, as a person who has been busy benefitting immensely from the corruption perpetrated by these feudals, she has obstinately declined to reveal any incriminating information about these sensationally corrupt feudals. 
            </p>
      
            <p>
               When dealing in investigative journalism, people extremely frequently mention the five W’s of investigative journalism: What, Who, Why, Where, and Which. I would like to know WHAT precisely had Shams Zia, the despicable son of retired Mr. justice Zia Mehmood, done that proved to be of such gravity that all of the names of feudals and money in his pocket failed to convince the police officer to decline to write that FIR against him? That’s the first W. Once we are done with that, then I would like to know WHO were the aggrieved parties? Had he raped a woman somewhere? I would also like to know WHO else was involved, as I was told during the 1990s that at least two Mughals were involved in that criminal act? That’s the second W. With that done, I would like to know WHERE exactly was the crime committed? After that, I would like to know WHICH police officer dared to stand up to such a sensationally connected individual with such a heinous character? With that out of the way, I would once again like to use the WHAT from that list, and I would like to know WHAT exactly happened to that poor soul who decided to take on such an incredibly and remarkably well-connected yet abominable and execrable character who now presides over the proceedings in some high court or supreme court in Pakistan? What did they eventually do to that poor police officer who had the temerity to rile the ass-kissers of feudals from Multan and Sindh?  
            </p>
      
            <p>
               As a “sensationally competent” person who miserably failed to leave a record of even acceptable performances anywhere during her time in the educational system in various institutions in Lahore, Farah Zia, of course, possesses another job, as well: the judicious and meritorious rewards of being so spectacularly competent. When a person is as sensationally decent and as phenomenally competent as esteemed Farah Zia, then such a person does not get to earn money from one organization, but the desirability as an erudite member of society shoots straight through the stratosphere and the sensationally competent person ends up working for two organizations. The tale does not end with employment with two organizations, she has been receiving contracts from foreign media organizations, as well. As one such outstandingly competent person, she, of course, works for an esteemed human rights body, as well. 
            </p>
      
            <p>
               While beating the drum of human rights and getting paid for it, it NEVER occurred to our much loved, esteemed, spectacularly well-informed, and phenomenally judicious Farah Zia that the appointment of her sensationally incompetent brother who had once committed such a grave crime that the police officer resolutely declined to expunge the FIR was a flagrant, repulsive, and despicable abuse of the rights of a more competent law graduate with a much better character record. It just did not occur to her once that these appointments of her siblings who never, ever possessed the right qualifications and character to serve in certain positions were repugnant and obscene abuses of the human rights of more qualified candidates with much better records, both academic and character; most of the individuals belonging to Mughlia clan have inherent character issues. This refusal to reveal these details should result in another criminal charge of egregious, nauseating wilful negligence and criminal concealment of critical, crucial details just to provide protection to her siblings and cousins and benefit from all of the corruption taking place in the system. Proceeds of Crime Act and concealment of incriminating details to protect criminals related legal clauses should apply here, as her persistent and uncompromising refusal to reveal the details of corruption perpetrated by her father using Fazal Zia’s connections with the feudals amounts to unqualified protection to criminals for personal financial gains and personal enrichment. 
            </p>
      
            <p>
               Then there is the spectacular tale of another one of Farah Zia’s cousins named Aziz Mirza who is a retired Lt. Col in the armed forces of Pakistan. After his initial failure to excel in the armed forces, as he could only manage the rank of Lt. Col when people go on to become brigadiers and generals, he found a job as a so-called engineer with an organization directly managed by the armed forces of Pakistan called NLC, or National Logistics Cell. While working at NLC, he could only ever manage to get his hands on a spectacularly third-class Mazda truck and never got any significant promotions during his 13 or 14 years long stay with NLC. However, during that stay at NLC, he and his spectacularly corrupt and notorious wife, both of whom were ardent and vociferous admirers of the sensationally corrupt Zia Mehmood, arranged a stay for Zia Mehmood’s spectacularly incompetent and despicable son, namely Shams Zia, at Aziz Mirza’s wife’s elder brother’s house in the UK. Owing to all of the services provided to Zia Mehmood’s family, Mr. Aziz Mirza was eventually able to land a job at NHA as head of the administrative department during spectacularly corrupt General Pervez Musharraf’s tenure. Pervez Musharraf had hand-picked all of the sensationally close allies of the Bhutto Clan, and one of those sensationally close allies of the Bhutto clan just happened to be Mr. Zia Mehmood Mirza.</p>
		
	   <p>Thanks entirely to the services that Aziz Mirza had rendered to Zia Mehmood’s family by providing his son a safe and comfortable place to live in England while he was enrolled for his LLM, where he once again failed to perform well, Aziz Mirza, during Pervez Musharraf’s tenure, got an extremely rewarding job entirely owing to his connections with Zia Mehmood. During that period, spectacularly corrupt Mr. Zia Mehmood got appointed as the head of Privatisation Commission of Pakistan by General Pervez Musharraf. Considering that I have known Aziz Mirza for over 32 years, and I was a frequent visitor to his house during my early-to-mid teens, I can say with an exceedingly high degree of confidence that sensational, spectacular Mr. Aziz Mirza failed to perform well during his undergraduate studies while studying for a degree in civil engineering. During his time at NLC, to the point of certainty, he was merely working as a senior foreman fluent in English with hardly acceptable knowledge of civil engineering.
            </p>
      
            <p>
               The appointment of Aziz Mirza was another flagrant abuse of the human rights of some other better-educated and much more decent Pakistani, however, owing to his phenomenal ties with Zia Mehmood, he managed to land that job. As part of the package at NHA, this poorly educated engineer received a brand new Toyota Parado jeep and a Honda Civic for helping the regime of sensationally corrupt General Pervez Musharraf. Based on all of the activities that I have witnessed over the last 35 years or so, I call this breathtaking move up the hierarchy that included the incredible replacement of a third-class Mazda truck with a brand new Toyota Parado and a Honda Civic The Grand, Grand Switcharoo arranged entirely with the help of Zia Mehmood, Fazal Zia, and the feudals. While operating as a member of the investigative journalistic community and a venerable human rights body funded by the European Union, the absolute darling of the Mughlia clan, the remarkable, extraordinary, and fabulous Farah Zia has never, not once, felt the need to disclose this abuse of rights of some much better qualified and decent member of the Pakistani society, as well. Farah Zia’s fabulous tale of the concealment of crucial and incriminating details for personal gains is quite fabulous.

               When it comes to the list of human rights abuses perpetrated by the mighty Zia Mehmood and his family, we, of course, have another name on this list. The sensational existence named Farah Zia is married to a guy named Asad Jamal. After marrying the extremely dumb yet outstandingly well-connected Farah Zia, Mr. Asad Jamal was able to make a sensational move up the hierarchy, as well, remarkably similar to the move that Mr. Aziz Mirza had managed to secure. From working in a bank as a not-at-all high-ranking officer, Mr. Asad Jamal was able to land a job straight in Pervez Musharraf’s setup as a person working on the esteemed and vaunted Freedom of Information Act, and getting rewarded extremely handsomely for that vacuous job title. The vacuousness of the title can be proven using the mere fact that all of these details about the heinous crimes of these people, one of whom was working on the exulted and celebrated Freedom Of Information Act, are now being written by a person who has yet to receive a single penny for writing all of these details.

               Farah Zia and her terrific and fabulous husband have been brutally violating the human rights of other people, yet this fellow, who goes by the name of Asad Jamal, was getting paid handsomely for working on the Freedom of Information Act: not mere irony, but the mother of all ironies! One of the most corrupt members of the wider Mughlia clan was busy getting rewarded handsomely for working on how to get information from various government departments, while that same person and her wife have been actively concealing crucial, incriminating details singularly for personal gains and enrichment. Proceeds of Crime Act applies in the case of both of them, as they have been privy to some extremely disgusting details regarding their near and dear ones, for example, Zia Mehmood, Shams Zia, Iram Zia, and the political elite belonging to the mighty Peoples Party of Pakistan.

               All of the aforementioned heinous abuses of the rights of various people and wilful participation in many criminal activities aside, which involve multiple flagrant abuses of authority, this startlingly and staggeringly decent and humane individual who goes by the name of Farah Zia has probably, the likelihood of which is through the stratosphere, never written a single word about the working conditions that are afforded to educated workers in Pakistan. As a former school topper and a person with an almost excellent grasp of the English language, while I was still actively looking for a job in 2004–2005, I gained first-hand experience of the sort of work environments that are offered to people in places like call centers and other offices. Educated workers perfectly fluent in English in Pakistan were being offered work spaces almost similar to fish markets and chicken farms, yet these people enjoying luxuries in cities like Lahore and Karachi, for example, the breathtakingly sensational Farah Zia and Ansar Burni, have never tried to raise their voices for the rights of these workers. Workers in Pakistan are still getting treated diabolically, yet these champions of human rights continue to enjoy luxuries while taking zero action to improve the condition of the working class.

               When I was studying for my matriculation certificate in Jhelum, I used to see my teachers with first-class degrees in mathematics, physics, and chemistry, who were busy imparting knowledge to talented people, commuting between their workplace and houses on bicycles. I have miserably failed to expunge from my memory the horrendous treatment of well-read teachers, yet these champions of human rights like Farah Zia and Ansar Burni have probably never tried to wage any wars on behalf of these diabolically treated teachers. Apart from hiding exceptionally incriminating details on her family’s long list of corruption so far, which they have perpetrated with the help of phenomenally connected feudals, this sensational existence has done spectacularly little to improve the ground realities of ordinary workers, very well-read teachers working in high schools, and other people. These individuals working for most of the human rights bodies largely focus on their own paychecks and comforts. Teachers, whose daily efforts during those years, have played a crucial part in turning me into a person who can now communicate freely, solve problems, thoroughly examine user experience-related matters, and read material that I deem interesting, were and still are being treated despicably in Pakistan, yet these human rights activists have no issues with that.</p>

		<p>This blatant refusal to talk about the diabolical treatment of educated workers and well-read to intelligent and extremely well-read teachers should result in another charge of gross negligence. The whole of the circumstance surrounding the horrific treatment of teachers and even blue collar works raises the question that if I, who has not once declared himself a humanitarian or human rights activist, have not been able to expunge from my memory the horrendous treatment of my teachers and the dire need felt by me of the need to improve their circumstances, then why have these champions of human rights not been able to see these horrendous, horrific violations of the rights of these intelligent and extremely well-read teachers? Most of the people working in the field of human rights tend to have extremely bad academic records, yet they, with the help of spectacularly corrupt leaders, manage to arrange for themselves extremely comfortable lifestyles. These people working in the field of human rights in Pakistan are busy using vacuous, wholly untenable statements mostly relying on abuses that women have to face in Pakistan when they aren’t facing too many, and despite reliance on wholly untenable statements, they continue to earn extremely decent sums. While people who have to work daily, people with knowledge of and expertise in difficult to very difficult subjects like physics, mathematics, chemistry, engineering, and medicine, continue to live in very difficult to difficult circumstances. This woman and her family have benefitted immensely and continue to benefit by promoting the agenda of placed on the table by feudals and major players operating in the land mafia sector. They have shown absolutely zero concern when it comes to the plight of people that the decent individuals in the knowledge economy deem respectable, venerable, and dear nor have they shown any concern for the well being of blue collar workers.

               That, my fellow beings and especially Pakistanis, is the sensational, spectacular tale of a woman working the twin fields of investigative journalism and human rights here in Pakistan and enjoying luxuries in Lahore, the beloved darling of some Mughals from Mulhal who goes by the name of Farah Zia, daughter of retired justice Zia Mehmood Mirza. How much more corrupt can the judiciary get, just try to imagine.

               Some documents that are publicly available on American and other servers that describe tersely the circumstances and conditions that have to be met for the charges that I listed against Farah Zia. For all of these charges, the conditions listed have to be met for them to be taken seriously and for officially charging the person with those crimes.
