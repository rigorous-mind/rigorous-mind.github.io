      <p stlye = "color: Cyan; font-size:25px;">Owing to circumstances outside of my control, I have not been able to finish this article. It is currently written in bits and pieces and lacks formal flow. Circumstances permitting, I will try to finish it within the next couple of weeks by trying to impart proper flow and add more comprehensive, convincing data to prove what society has deemed these destructive pests so far.</p>
        
			<p> Minority Report: AKA Social Proof: What exactly is social proof? General population almost always wants to establish relationships with decent, likeable, and especially competent people. That’s what these people from Mulehal and Noorwal and Butts have been saying, yet their previous generation and current generations have had spectacular levels difficulty finding any decent partners.  Why are the companions of the previous generation and this generation so spectacularly incompetent and mostly extremely notorious. Surgical analysis of the two minority groups living in GP1 and Noorwal — they obdurately declined to listen. T60 Abrams. I have already started writing a post titled Minority Report: Look for it. Always, always keep in mind the grade inflation stuff; A F. G. High School teacher who goes be the name of Farkhunda Akbar told me herself that board sends them directives to include at least 1 or more than one extremely easy question so that the education boards can inflate their statistics. Saman Mujeed: Ahmad Hafeez 3 times matriculation fail, fourth time pass on grade inflation.</p>
        
			<p>In the year 2005 and then in the year 2008, I told the children of Anwar Hussain Mirza and most of the children of his children explicitly that I do not want to socialize with them under any circumstances. Since then, they have been harassing me incessantly. Circumstances permitting, I am planning to reveal the complete details of their families’ affairs to shed some light on what sort of people they have been deemed by the society so far, and how phenomenally good they have been deemed as tormentors of decent, competent folks. For the time being, though, I would just like to share a small paragraph from that planned work. A selected paragraph to shed some light on these people and their affairs. </p>

			<p>Anwar Hussain and his children along with Anwar Hussain’s sister and some other relatives settled in Jhelum in the late 1950s or mid 1960s. A tale of what ensued their in Jhelum.</p>

			<p>Anwar Hussain’s children, which include people like Aziz Mirza, Anwar Mirza, Abid Mirza, and their 8 sisters — gained maturity in Jhelum, and all of them were not able to find any decent or well read partners. Almost all of them have extremely poorly educated or extremely poorly educated and remarkably notorious marriage partners. One of the sisters, whose children’s details of horrendous conduct you can read here, eventually had to settle for a person who is not only extremely poorly educated but also physically disabled. People in Pakistan almost always try to steer clear of physically disabled people; however, owing to their trail of horrific conduct in the city of Jhelum, none of the sisters were able to find acceptable marriage partners. One of the sisters is married to a person who could not even manage 33% marks in BA and consequently does not have a BA qualification while studying spectacularly easy subjects. A short paragraph from my planned work to disclose the conduct of a complete family unit that has been incessantly harassing me as we have an almost complete dysfunctional law enforcement structure in Pakistan. </p>

<p>The brother who managed to qualify for a spot in the armed forces, namely Aziz Mirza has been running a criminal ring in Rawalpindi using phenomenally notorious and sensationally incompetent people named Omar Mirza and Hassan Mirza. Having failed to find a suitable partner in Jhelum, he had to marry the niece of that physically disabled person. That woman has a truly tarnished reputation, and despite possessing a British passport and not having any physical flaws, she was not able to find a suitable partner in the whole of the Lahore. Almost to the point of certainty, that person had managed to earn spectacular levels of notoriety in the area of Lahore where they were living, and she kept regaling youngsters with her physique even after her marriage. In Pakistan, almost one third of the population wants to leave for foreign countries, yet despite possessing a British passport, this woman had to settle for a person who had failed to find a suitable partner in Jhelum. Not only was the woman perfectly fair, she had an extremely attractive body and BA level education along with her British passport, and she now shared a compound with 5 of the family members of the effulgent creature named Aziz Mirza who failed to get even a BA level education. Almost the whole of the Pakistan knows that most of such individuals spend their time participating in truly nefarious activities while growing up, and the aforementioned holds perfectly true in the case of almost all of them as I know them personally. They are my father’s spectacularly close relatives. When it comes the people that she and her husband have been living with, in all reality, at least 8 individuals do not have simple BA certificates. In Pakistan, the education departments in all of the provinces are busy in an activity called grade inflation by including at least 1, usually 2, extremely easy questions in the papers. How do I know that? I was educated in a school managed by Federal Government, and we used to have a special exam in 8th grade designed solely for the top 10 students in the school. The exam, even for talented students, did not use to be extremely difficult, however, as it used to be aimed at only competent children, hence, the papers used to more difficult than the usual papers equating to a much thorough evaluation of the participating children. Almost all of the students in the F. G. Board who during the 90s and early 2000s managed to get 730 or 735 marks, which equate to almost 86% points, were averaging around 80 to 81% marks in those exams where papers were only devised for a select group. When it comes to grade inflation in Urdu medium schools, the situation is even worse. I had the opportunity to comete in FSc against student with 735 marks in matriculation who had studied in Urdu medium schools, and they failed to successfully competet against a person who had had a poor matriculation preparation as my extra curriculars had increased from 5 to approximately 7 or 8. Despite my poor preparation in 10th that meant I had to mount a proper recovery in the 11th grade, I was still able to beat some of them as they had come from an educational system where the grade inflation was even higher. Hence, I can say with utmost certainty that had such levels of grade inflation not been taking place, then the companions of that woman from Lahore must have included at least 8 people without a matriculation certificate. Despite her British passport, good phsyque, and fair complexion, all of the aspects of a female’s personality that are deemed extremely desirable in Pakistan, she has been living in the company of some of the most outstandingly incompetent people who had grown up in households where both of the parents were already so-called educated people. Both the husband and wife have managed to tarnish the already extremely tarnished reputation of the Mughlia clan in a rather spectacular manner. Almost no half decent family is willing to socialize with them in Rawalpindi now.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for me, I am one of those youngster who had to tolerate her shameless display of smart body and well endowed chest. Now, owing entirely to the notoriety that family has managed to earn in Rawalpindi as both husband and wife declined to learn any lesson from their past, the couple’s dauhter, despite the couple desperate attempts to find a suitable partner, is married to one of the most notorious and extremely incompetent person named Danish Butt. While the girl has a successfully finished degree in mechatronics from NUST and now hold a PhD, her husband failed to learn even 8th mathematics and general science even to an acceptable level. He was one of the most notorious boys in the whole of the Mangla, and the couple, namely Aziz Mirza and Shabana Aziz, had to eventually settle for that guy. In the whole of the Rawalpindi and despite having relatives in Lahore and Gujrat, they were not able to find a better partner. Their search started from our house as I was the first chosen target for that girl. </p>

<p>A short chapter or few pages on Nida Aziz: what are the chances of finding people in such unions? Successful NUST graduate and a guy with nothing to put on the table: character: gutter; academics: gutter; extra curriculars: gutter; stage presentation: gutter.</p>

<p>Shaista Jamil and Jamil Butt: Remarkably charming woman with a physically handicapped guy with a second class second in English literature, Misbah Kiani married to a guy with who failed to manage 33% in simple BA, Uzma Hafeez, who all her life kept singing songs about her own physical beauty, married to a family in Noorwal that just about nobody want to touch. Shanaz Salahudin who was and remained all her life such a horrendous woman that she got divorced within the first year of her marriage; got married to a much older person with 3 children and wreaked havoc over there as I was forced to stay at her place as my father has been a sensational decision maker. Anjum Sajid is married to a spectacularly incompetent lawyer who, for the most part after the birth of her first two daughters, remained an alcoholic and largely declined to do any work. The Mughlia clan from Mulhal very proudly presents itself as a group that can trace its lineage way back to Royal court of Raja Akbar Mughal and they have been participating in these activities which are all related to nafasat, adub, taleem-o-tadrees, philosophy, and culture, yet, despite making all of these bold, brash claims, all of the previous members belonging to the previous generation failed to find any acceptable marriage partners and have remained in lifelong miserable relationships where people barely tolerate each other’s existences. </p>

<p>Why do people who manage to pass matriculation in the first attempt, start to fail exams upon reaching FA and BA. Omar Mirza, who managed to pass matriculation in the first attempt, failed BA with much easier subjects than his matriculation curriculum because he had become spectacularly active in all of the wrong circles in Chakwal. I have an example of two brothers, the elder of who managed to earn my complete respect as a student and athlete, yet the younger who had barely managed to pass the matriculation exam in the first attemp, upon getting a motorbike in 11th grade, became extremely active in all of the wrong circles and failed to pass FSc, failed to get the bare minimum 33%, at least 3 times all because of the same reason, becoming extremely active in all of the wrong reasons. </p>

<p>Daleets A tWork Les Untouchables  The Cell guy has been facing a dilemma, gharaq hai koam kay gham main: Sameer Aziz</p>

<p>Jamil Butt — The Butt Clan’s Star: Got kicked out and demoted from Mangla where all of the teachers were living at least acceptable abodes with almost free electricity and air conditioners running everywhere. I can only presume that just like his tormenter children, he managed to truly infuriate somebody to receive that demotion and found himself as an 8th grade teacher instead of a 9th and 10th grade teacher in Mangla. In Jhelum, he did not even have any air conditioning available. The whole of his circumstance imploded as a result of this transfer. I can say with almost certainty, or at least with an extremely high degree of confidence, that he secured his place back in Mangla with the help of his elder brother General Pervez Butt. Some horrendous folks. </p>
