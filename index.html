		Before narrating the tale of this woman’s reprehensible, criminal conduct so far and the general state of affairs in Pakistan, let me disclose the charges that I, as a person not well-versed in legal matters, feel should be leveled against her. I am certain that in a free and fair trial, which is spectacularly difficult to arrange in Pakistan, she would be found guilty of at least a few of the following charges. As an extremely concerned member of Pakistani society who has witnessed all of this conduct, I firmly believe that she should be tried and put behind bars without any leniency or plea deals.

               Since the start of the Internet boom in the late 1990s and early 2000s, the so-called exceptional entrepreneurial minds of silicon valley and the rest of the mighty US of A have been trying their darndest to create one sensational story-grabbing business after another. The very first attempt, if I am not mistaken, was to liberalize printing of information on the Internet. As a result of that half-baked promise, we now have billions of digital pages on the mighty Internet, an absolute majority of which are languishing in obscurity with negligible to almost zero visits per day. The whole of the business of getting a higher ranking on Google and Bing has become so formulaic, commercial, and unremarkable in nature that reading the posts that reach the coveted top spots has become an infuriating affair in itself.

               Our latest revolutionary, another in the long list of revolutionaries that Pakistan has managed to produce in the last 6 decades, has been shouting at the top of his lungs for at least 3.5 decades now that Pakistan is replete with talent. We have all sorts of talent that is waiting to be unearthed. As I have grown up in this country and watched the esteemed nation dabble in all sorts of activities and with diabolical results almost everywhere, so just last night I decided to take a look at Pakistan’s record in the summer Olympics in the last 75 years.

            The prevalent advice on how to achieve higher ranking on Google’s result pages is to use the keywords as often as you can as the author of the article. However, to create this impression on the readers as well as the algorithm evaluating your text that you have not tried to overwhelm the text with keywords without assigning any importance to the flow of writing, the usual SEO experts also advise the newcomers to lengthen the article and create some flow by introducing multiple paragraphs in your article regardless of their irrelevance to the subject at hand. The most commonly furnished advice is to start by touching upon the basics of the subjects or relying on the historical context to unnecessarily lengthen the article just to use those keywords as often as you can to satisfy the needs of the algorithms currently in use.

            All of us have to start from somewhere for one reason or another. While growing up, some of us develop a profound interest in an activity or two, while others are forced to take up a profession because their stubborn parents without thoroughly evaluating the situation force their children to take up a profession. The rest have to decide based on their faculties and grades that of all of the remaining options, which would either suit them best or which would provide the highest return on investment of time and effort. Whatever the underlying reasons may be, we then have to study newer subjects and learn new tools. As a 46-year-old who has had to learn the tricks of the trade the hard way — you can read the reasons for the very many false steps in this post — I would like to share my tips for improving your workflow while spending your money wisely, as well.

            Some time ago, I stumbled upon a YouTube video by an American YouTuber in which he claimed that while in Pakistan, he found it extremely difficult to pay for the stuff that he was buying from the local vendors. Even at the time of watching that video for the first time, I found his claim nigh on impossible to believe. There are at least a couple of reasons for finding his claim unbelievable.

            Those of you who primarily or entirely browse on mobile phones will most probably not find this post of much use at all. Additionally, only ardent users of the keyboard who dislike reliance on a mouse will benefit the most from the simple tip contained in this post.
