		Before narrating the tale of this woman’s reprehensible, criminal conduct so far and the general state of affairs in Pakistan, let me disclose the charges that I, as a person not well-versed in legal matters, feel should be leveled against her. I am certain that in a free and fair trial, which is spectacularly difficult to arrange in Pakistan, she would be found guilty of at least a few of the following charges. As an extremely concerned member of Pakistani society who has witnessed all of this conduct, I firmly believe that she should be tried and put behind bars without any leniency or plea deals.

               Since the start of the Internet boom in the late 1990s and early 2000s, the so-called exceptional entrepreneurial minds of silicon valley and the rest of the mighty US of A have been trying their darndest to create one sensational story-grabbing business after another. The very first attempt, if I am not mistaken, was to liberalize printing of information on the Internet. As a result of that half-baked promise, we now have billions of digital pages on the mighty Internet, an absolute majority of which are languishing in obscurity with negligible to almost zero visits per day. The whole of the business of getting a higher ranking on Google and Bing has become so formulaic, commercial, and unremarkable in nature that reading the posts that reach the coveted top spots has become an infuriating affair in itself.

               Our latest revolutionary, another in the long list of revolutionaries that Pakistan has managed to produce in the last 6 decades, has been shouting at the top of his lungs for at least 3.5 decades now that Pakistan is replete with talent. We have all sorts of talent that is waiting to be unearthed. As I have grown up in this country and watched the esteemed nation dabble in all sorts of activities and with diabolical results almost everywhere, so just last night I decided to take a look at Pakistan’s record in the summer Olympics in the last 75 years.
