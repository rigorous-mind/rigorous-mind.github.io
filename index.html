            <p>
		Before narrating the tale of this womanâ€™s reprehensible, criminal conduct so far and the general state of affairs in Pakistan, let me disclose the charges that I, as a person not well-versed in legal matters, feel should be leveled against her. I am certain that in a free and fair trial, which is spectacularly difficult to arrange in Pakistan, she would be found guilty of at least a few of the following charges. As an extremely concerned member of Pakistani society who has witnessed all of this conduct, I firmly believe that she should be tried and put behind bars without any leniency or plea deals.
