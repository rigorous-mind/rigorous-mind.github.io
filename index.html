The sheer good fortune of being born in Pakistan and witnessing the society at large is the sensational level of human rights abuses and corruption that a person has to witness. However, the magnum opus, the crowning glory, of all of the phenomenal levels of corruption perpetrated by Pakistanis and almost entirely funded by the UK and Europe is an individual named Omar Mirza, son of a phenomenal Abid Mirza who was himself an exceedingly notorious and remarkably incompetent mighty Mughal, who once again belongs to the mighty Mughlia clan from Mulhal Mughlan near Chakwal.

	When I was growing up in the city of Jhelum, I met a young teenage boy named Zeshan Haider in 8th grade. During our very first meeting near what used to be our F. G. School’s football ground’s goalpost, he started conducting an interview to get to know me better. During that interview, he asked various questions to get to know me and my habits better, and one line of questioning focused on whether the tale involving the telepaths in the series Daiwta in what used to be Suspense digest was real or not. Initially, Zeshan’s questioning focused on what sort of books and digests I used to read, and whether I had ever read stories in Suspense digest? Upon becoming aware of the fact that I used to read Suspense and Jasoosi digest regularly, he started inquiring about the tale discussed in the Daiwta story. When I started mentioning the characters and the fact that I used to follow that tale with some fervor, he inquired about my opinion or faith in telepathic powers. I told him that I considered it merely a work of fiction and such transference of thought or power was not possible.

		Before narrating the tale of this woman’s reprehensible, criminal conduct so far and the general state of affairs in Pakistan, let me disclose the charges that I, as a person not well-versed in legal matters, feel should be leveled against her. I am certain that in a free and fair trial, which is spectacularly difficult to arrange in Pakistan, she would be found guilty of at least a few of the following charges. As an extremely concerned member of Pakistani society who has witnessed all of this conduct, I firmly believe that she should be tried and put behind bars without any leniency or plea deals.

               Since the start of the Internet boom in the late 1990s and early 2000s, the so-called exceptional entrepreneurial minds of silicon valley and the rest of the mighty US of A have been trying their darndest to create one sensational story-grabbing business after another. The very first attempt, if I am not mistaken, was to liberalize printing of information on the Internet. As a result of that half-baked promise, we now have billions of digital pages on the mighty Internet, an absolute majority of which are languishing in obscurity with negligible to almost zero visits per day. The whole of the business of getting a higher ranking on Google and Bing has become so formulaic, commercial, and unremarkable in nature that reading the posts that reach the coveted top spots has become an infuriating affair in itself.

               Our latest revolutionary, another in the long list of revolutionaries that Pakistan has managed to produce in the last 6 decades, has been shouting at the top of his lungs for at least 3.5 decades now that Pakistan is replete with talent. We have all sorts of talent that is waiting to be unearthed. As I have grown up in this country and watched the esteemed nation dabble in all sorts of activities and with diabolical results almost everywhere, so just last night I decided to take a look at Pakistan’s record in the summer Olympics in the last 75 years.

            The prevalent advice on how to achieve higher ranking on Google’s result pages is to use the keywords as often as you can as the author of the article. However, to create this impression on the readers as well as the algorithm evaluating your text that you have not tried to overwhelm the text with keywords without assigning any importance to the flow of writing, the usual SEO experts also advise the newcomers to lengthen the article and create some flow by introducing multiple paragraphs in your article regardless of their irrelevance to the subject at hand. The most commonly furnished advice is to start by touching upon the basics of the subjects or relying on the historical context to unnecessarily lengthen the article just to use those keywords as often as you can to satisfy the needs of the algorithms currently in use.

            All of us have to start from somewhere for one reason or another. While growing up, some of us develop a profound interest in an activity or two, while others are forced to take up a profession because their stubborn parents without thoroughly evaluating the situation force their children to take up a profession. The rest have to decide based on their faculties and grades that of all of the remaining options, which would either suit them best or which would provide the highest return on investment of time and effort. Whatever the underlying reasons may be, we then have to study newer subjects and learn new tools. As a 46-year-old who has had to learn the tricks of the trade the hard way — you can read the reasons for the very many false steps in this post — I would like to share my tips for improving your workflow while spending your money wisely, as well.

            Some time ago, I stumbled upon a YouTube video by an American YouTuber in which he claimed that while in Pakistan, he found it extremely difficult to pay for the stuff that he was buying from the local vendors. Even at the time of watching that video for the first time, I found his claim nigh on impossible to believe. There are at least a couple of reasons for finding his claim unbelievable.
