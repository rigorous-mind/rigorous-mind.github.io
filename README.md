ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Irfan, the creator of the repository @rigorous-mind. As an individual with an eclectic personality, I have a wide range of interests, from mathematics to various sciences, typography to almost expert-level front-end development, gun shooting to plants, visual arts to poetry, howevevr, I am here to launch a static website to shatter certain beaten-to-dust tropes of the Pakistani socienty and the level of corruption taking place in our society. I have chosen this platform as it allows the most freedom when it comes to choosing the structure of the marked-up text and desinging the layout of the page.

Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on refining the layout of my website hosted on GitHub and improving the quality of my writing to make it as professionally and convincingly presented as possible. If a thoroughly decent person would like to evaluate my design and written content to provide some insights, then you would find me extremely receptive to convincing ideas, methodologies, and techniques of improving the quality of my written works and the presentation of my website.

How to reach me: you can send me a message on Instagram. My ID is irfan.uxd. As I have had the unadulterated pleasure of exchanging messages with some of the most obnoxious people around me, hence, I instantaneously ban people without any real insights into the types of works I have mentioned above. I have had to hear some spectacular levels of mind rattlingly asinine gibberish from spectacularly delusional idiots in my lifetime, hence, I have an extremely low threshold for idiocy. If you feel that you would not be able to add much to what I have already written or the way I have structured my work, then I would advise you to try not to contact me.

Pronouns: He/Him

Fun fact 1: As a former gun shooter, I used to shoot down match sticks from a distance of approximately 20â€“25 feet with my air gun.

Fun Fact 2: In my 20s, as a fan of solving number sequences, during that time, I managed to solve all of the number sequences presented to me barring one. The one which I failed to solve involved converting the numbers into binary and then studying the sequence.

Fun Fact 3: I prepared for the SATâ€™s mathematics section in just one day without any tutoring and almost aced the exam at FASTâ€“NUCES entrance test.
